Public collection of fun small projects

## Contents
- [Simply Breathe](https://simplybreathe.space/) - a simple deep breathing assistant that changes color with the time of day
- [Confetti Burst](https://simplybreathe.space/confetti.html) - An explosion of color with every click - each click
generates only as many dots as have flown offscreen.
- [Background Noise of the Universe](https://simplybreathe.space/static.html) - Inspired by the word "Infinity" for Day 1
of #Codevember 2018. Dots are generated and clean up after themselves as they float around the screen. Stare at it to
enhance your calm.
